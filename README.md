# XMPP Encrypted Chat Java

The main objective of this project is to allow the users to share data and chat with each
other instantly by a secured medium. The primary focus of this application is on the
security and encryption of the data so that third parties may not see the exchange of
personal data. Also, to provide users an alternative to the traditional medium of short
message exchange services like SMS and MMS, which are both unsecure and allow for a
limited exchange of data at a time.
